Salutations to you O fierce one, salutations to the valiant one, salutations to the one with variegated colours, hail to you Oh furious one!

Salutations to Martandaya the son of Mrukanda Maharisi, the terrible and fierce one, the mighty hero, the one that travels fast. Salutations to the one whose appearance makes the lotus blossom (also the awakener of the lotus in the heart)
