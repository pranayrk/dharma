## वेदाश्च क्रतवश्चैव क्रतूनां फलमेव च ।
vēdāśca kratavaścaiva kratūnāṁ phalamēva ca
## यानि कृत्यानि लोकेषु सर्व एष रविः प्रभुः ॥
yāni kr̥tyāni lokēṣu sarva ēṣa raviḥ prabhuḥ

> The Sun is verily the Lord of all action in this universe. He is verily the vedas, the sacrifices mentioned in them and the fruits obtained by performing the sacrifices.
<!--
He comprises all the gods, as well as the fruits of the sacrifices also. He is supremely competent, one of all activities which is found in all the worlds.

The Sun God (Ravi) is the origin and protector of the four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva), the sacrifices mentioned in them and the fruits obtained by performing the sacrifices. He is the Lord of all action in this universe and decides the Universal path.
