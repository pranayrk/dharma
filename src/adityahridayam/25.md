## एनमापत्सु कृच्छ्रेषु कान्तारेषु भयेषु च ।
ēnamāpatsu kr̥cchrēṣu kāntārēṣu bhayēṣu ca
## कीर्तयन् पुरुषः कश्चिन्नावसीदति राघव ॥
kīrtayan puruṣaḥ kaścinnāvasīdati rāghava

> Raghava, one who recites this hymn in times of danger, during an affliction or when lost in the wilderness and having fear, he will not lose heart (and become brave).
<!--
Listen, Oh Rāghava, any person, singing the glories of Surya in great difficulties, during affliction, while lost in the wilderness, and when beset with fear, will not come to grief.

Listen Oh Rama! Oh Ragava, scion of the Raghu dynasty, any person, singing the glories of Surya in great difficulties, during affliction, while lost in the wilderness, and when beset with fear, will not come to grief (or loose heart).
