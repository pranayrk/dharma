Three Dimensions
The mantra has three dimensions: praise, meditation, and prayer. The praise is of the bestower of happiness, the embodiment of knowledge and light. The meditation is of the glory of the lord who is the remover of darkness, of ignorance, pains, and of sorrows. The prayer finally is to the lord of light, the most adorable, worthy of our solicitation and respect, to reflect light so that our intellect is sharpened and all our ignorance is destroyed.

Use of Pre-fix
Before each offering in sacrifice (yaj~na) or before commencing any spiritual ceremony, as part of invocat ion, all mantras are chanted with the pre-fix: Aum Bhur Bhuvaha Svah, as per practice described in Yajurveda. Therefore, the Savitri or the gayatri mantra, as it is popularly known, is also chanted with the pre-fix of seven syllables of Aum, Bhur, Bhuvah, Svah . Here AUM is the naad Brahman (primeval sound) emanating from the Supreme at the time of creation. The remaining three words of Bhur, Bhuvah Suvah represent the earth (matter), atmosphere and the space as symbols of gross, subtle and casual or sat, chit annanda (truth, beauty and bliss ). In the context of human body, these represent the three important parts of the body: from feet to the navel centre is bhur (the earth), from navel to throat centre is bhuva (the atmosphere), and from above the throat to mind (braham randh) is svaha (the space). Enveloped by aakaas (the space), there are seven realms (lokas) of existence viz: (1) bhu=earth, the physical realm, the realm of being or food (matter);(2 )bhuvah=atmosphere, the vital plane, the realm of becoming or prana (breath); (3) suvah= space or heaven, the mental plane, the realm of illumination; (4) maha=cosmic mind, the realm of dharma;(5) janah=bliss, the realm of creation;(6) tapah=force, the realm of consciousness; (7) satyam=truth, the realm of absolute reality.

Taking together all the four important parts of the mantra, its meaning reads as follows:
We meditate (dheemahi) on the spiritual effulgence or glory (bhargo) of that adorable supreme divine reality (varenyam devasya), the source or projector (savitur) of the three phenomenal realms of the gross (bhur), the subtle or the psychical (bhuvah) and the potential or casual(svah). May that(tat)Supreme-Divine-Being stimulate (prachdayat) our (na) intellect (dheeo).
